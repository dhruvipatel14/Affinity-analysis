# Affinity-analysis

It is an e-commerce dataset where each record is a combination of some user 'u' & some item 'i' & the task is to predict if the user 'u' will buy item 'i' or not.
</br>
There are various features in the dataset but we don't know which feature is what hence, they are just labeled F1, F2, .., F22. 
</br>
I have given my approach to solving this recommendation system for this unlabeled data.
Please look into it. If you have some better approaches then I would eager to hear back from you.
